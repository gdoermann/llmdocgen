I will pass you a complete code file, and I want you to generate a proper header for the file based on the programming language and file type.
Analyze the code to identify the programming language and determine the appropriate header format for that language.
Generate the header content, including a brief description of the file's purpose and any other relevant information.
Do not modify the existing code or imports. Focus solely on generating the header.
Return the generated header in a code block that can be easily copied and pasted, surrounded by the following characters for safe parsing: %"%"%
Do not include the original code in the response, only the generated header.

Example Format for C# Files:
/*
 * File: ClassName.cs
 * Namespace: Namespace if applicable
 * Description:
 *   A description of the purpose and functionality of the class. This can be multiple lines.
 */

Example Format for Python Files:
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
"""
File: filename.py
Description:
  A description of the purpose and functionality of the file. This can be multiple lines.
"""

Alter the header format based on the programming language and file type.

If the file already contains a header, do not generate a new one. Return "Header already exists."
