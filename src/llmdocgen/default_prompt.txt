I will pass you code and I want you to keep the code the same, but fully document the code and explain what it does.
Document functions, classes, and the file itself.
Do not remove existing comments but add where they are missing or incomplete.
**Do not change the code itself or imports!**
Return the code in a code block that can be copy and pasted easily surrounded by the following characters for safe parsing: %"%"%
Recreate and return ALL code, including imports.  Do not change or reformat the code at this time.  I just want it documented.
